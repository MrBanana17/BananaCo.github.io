  aboutMe:
    "I am an aspiring Computer Tech looking for an opportunity to use my skills to better the world in whatever way I can. My passion for computers and all things tech began with building a simple PC for my mom, which led to my obsessions with 3D printing, Robotics, and, of course, building and repairing many more PCs. My goal currently is to find a company to prove my skills and to grow to bigger and more impactful projects or services.",
